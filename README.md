# FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project

This repository contains my completed FreeCodeCamp tribute page project. The project was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Project Overview

I designed the tribute page differently from the freeCodeCamp tribute page to demonstrate my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. The FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page project is part of the Responsive Web Design Certification. It involves creating a webpage that pays tribute to someone you admire or find influential.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the tribute page structure.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the tribute page.

## Preview

Here's a screenshot of the tribute page:
